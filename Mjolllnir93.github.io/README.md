Future home page for Stellar Void, solo musical project of Samuel Foster.

Industrialized Berlin School synthesis meets the subconscious language of dreams

"Stellar Void is Primarily the work of me, Sam Foster. Once a regular and heavy hitting drummer in the San Francisco Metal scene of the late 90's and early Aughts. I can be heard on the album "Dead as Dreams" by influential US Black Metal band Weakling as well as releases from the progressive Death Metal band Saros. In 2010 I formed the heavy psychedelic rock band Hollow Mirrors (@hollowmirrors, and on Bandcamp)with Saros bass player Tim Scammell and guitarist / visual artist Bryce Shelton. While not currently active, both of these projects have gone far, in one way or another, in shaping my current musical path.

In 2014 everything went on hold while I began exploring the world of analog synthesis and the possibilities this opened. Several years of study, demoing and late night experimentation begat Stellar Void... with the goal of discovering new aural terrain in the negative space between genres and styles and embracing the silence of the mind... once in the Void, you may never want to come back.."
